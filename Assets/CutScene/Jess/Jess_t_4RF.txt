[Newln]*You sit next to Jessica at a lounge table.*
[Jess1]
[Newln]Hello.
[Newln]I’m glad you found some time.
[Newln]There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.
[Newln]Let's talk for a moment before that though.
[Newln]*Jessica sighs.*
[Newln]Nobody will be my partner for the final round.
[Newln]Unfortunately, it appears I scare everyone away.
[Newln]Except you.
[Newln]I think people would call me “odd”.
[Newln]I think those people are odd.
[Newln]Or maybe just intelligent.
[Newln]They don’t even know who I really am.
[Newln]They don’t bother to try to get to know me.
[Newln]That’s what I wanted to ask you.
[Newln]What do you think of me?
	[Display]You’re amazing.
		[Answer][Jess2]Are you really not ashamed of your honesty?
	[Display]You’re Jessica.
		[Answer][Jess3]Nevermind.
		[Answer]You should go.
		[Answer]*You leave.*
		[Answer][JessFail][SceneExit]
	[Display]You’re prickly.
		[Answer][Jess2]*She smiles.*
		[Answer]I know you don’t think that.
		[Answer]And even if you do, you’ve earned that opinion.

[JessSuccess]
[Newln]Well, I think you’re great.
[Newln]I don’t know why. 
[Newln]Frankly, you’re a complete idiot.
[Newln]And your dart skills are... 
[Newln]Interesting at best.
[Newln]However, despite all the negatives, you seem to be a diamond in the rough.
[Newln]*Jessica looks at you intently.*
[Newln]Please. 
[Newln]Consider me to be your partner for the final round.
[Newln]*Jessica relaxes.*
[Newln]With that off my chest you can go.
[Newln]Thank you for hearing me out.
[Newln]Really.
