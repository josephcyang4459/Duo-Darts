[Newln]*You see a unique woman dancing.*
[Newln]*Your eyes meet briefly and she walks over to you shortly after.*
[Jess1]
[Newln]Is there something you want?
	[Display]You.
		[Answer][Jess3]What a desperate thing for a professional to say.
	[Display]Nothing in particular.
		[Answer][Jess2][RaiseJessLove3]My mistake then.
	[Display]...
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove1]You are quite odd.
[Jess1]
[Newln]I just came to ask you to stop staring.
[Newln]It’s off putting.
[Newln]*She begins to return to her dancing, but stops and returns to you.*
[Newln]I need a dance partner.
[Newln]*She waits for a moment.*
[Newln]Well...
[Newln]Aren’t you going to ask me to dance?
[Newln]*You take her onto the dance floor and dance with her.
[Newln]You’re quite good at this.
[Newln]*She smirks.*
[Newln]I’m Jessica Fletcher.
[Newln]And I asked you to stop staring...
[Newln]*You and Jessica dance for a while.*
