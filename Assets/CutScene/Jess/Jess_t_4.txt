<*You sit next to Jessica at a table.*
<Hey.
<Im glad you found some time to talk.
<Theres something Ive been meaning to ask you.
<Lets talk for a moment though.
<*Jessica sighs.*
<Nobody will be my partner for the final round.
<Unfortunately, it appears I scare everyone away.
<Except you.
<I think people would call me prickly.
<I think those people are idiots.
<They dont even know who I really am.
<They dont bother to try to get to know me.
<Thats what I wanted to ask you.
<What do you think of me?
	$Youre amazing. -Success-
		&Are you really not ashamed of your honesty?
	$Youre Jessica. -Fail-
		&Nevermind.
		&You should go.
		&*You leave.*
	$Youre prickly. -Success-
		&*She smiles.*
		&I know you dont think that.
<I think youre great.
<I dont know why. Frankly youre a complete idiot.
<And your dart skills are... Interesting at best.
<However, despite all the negatives, you seem to be a diamond in the rough.
<*Jessica looks at you intently.*
<Please. 
<Consider me to be your partner for the final round.
<*Jessica relaxes.*
<With that off my chest you can go.
<Thank you for hearing me out.
<Really.
