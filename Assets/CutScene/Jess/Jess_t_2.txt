<You again?
<Maybe I shouldve seen it coming.
<You know drinking will only worsen your game.
<Speaking of darts...
<Ive never heard of you before tonight.
<Truthfully, I thought you might be some lucky startup to make it here.
<I guess we will see by the end of the night.
<So. What do you want to talk about?
	$Love. (++)
		&Maybe after Ive had much more to drink.
	$Death. (+++)
		&I couldve expected you to say something macabre or shocking like that.
	$Taxes. (+)
		&God help us.
<Maybe I should have asked why you keep coming up to socialize with me.
<Yes. Thats a much better question.
<*Jessica faces you and waits for an answer.*
<So?
	$Your skill. (+++)
		&Its refreshing that someone sees past the makeup to see the darts player that I truly am.
	$Your beauty.
		&*She sighs.*
		&At least youre trying.
	$No reason in particular. (++)
		&I call your bluff.
		&But fine, keep the reason to yourself.
<*Jessica faces away from you toward the bar.*
<Ive changed my mind again. 
<Let's talk about what you mentioned before.
<*You and Jessica talk for a while.*
