[Newln]*You find Jessica sitting at the bar.*
[Newln]*You notice how much she stands out from others.*
[Jess1]
[Newln]You again?
[Newln]Maybe I should’ve seen it coming.
[Newln]You know drinking will only worsen your game.
[Newln]Speaking of darts...
[Newln]I’ve never heard of you before tonight.
[Newln]Truthfully, I thought you might be some lucky startup to make it here.
[Newln]I guess we will see by the end of the night.
[Newln]So. What do you want to talk about?
	[Display]Love. 
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove2][Jess2]Maybe after I’ve had more to drink.
	[Display]Death. 
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove3][Jess2]*She laughs lightly.*
		[Answer]I could’ve expected you to say something macabre or shocking like that.
	[Display]Taxes. 
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove1]God help us.
[Jess1]
[Newln]Maybe I should have asked why you keep coming up to socialize with me.
[Newln]Yes. That’s a much better question.
[Newln]*Jessica faces you and waits for an answer.*
[Newln]So?
	[Display]Your skill.
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove3][Jess2]It’s refreshing that someone sees past the beauty to see the darts player that I truly am.
	[Display]Your beauty.
		[Answer]*She sighs.*
		[Answer]At least you’re trying.
	[Display]No reason in particular.
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove2][Jess2]I’ll call that a lie.
		[Answer]But fine, keep the reason to yourself.
[Jess1]
[Newln]*Jessica faces away from you toward the bar.*
[Newln]I’ve changed my mind again. 
[Newln]Let's talk about what you mentioned before.
[Newln]*You and Jessica talk for a while.*[RaiseIntox1][RaiseJessIntox1]
