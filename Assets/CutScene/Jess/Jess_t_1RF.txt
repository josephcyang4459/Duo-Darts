[Newln]I wouldn’t typically partner up with someone I don’t know rather well.
[Newln]However, with my skills I don’t mind the possibility of losing a few points.
[Newln]Even if you missed the board with most of your throws I still think we could pull through.
[Newln]What about you?
[Newln]Will you hold up your end of the game?
	[Display]I don’t miss my mark. 
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove2][Jess2]Well, aren’t you the confident one.
	[Display]I haven’t decided yet. 
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove3][Jess2]Indecision is an underrated trait.
	[Display]I’ll try. 
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove1]*She chuckles*.
		[Answer]I suppose we both will.

[Newln]I’ll let you go first.
[Newln]I would very much appreciate it if you didn’t make me work too hard to win.
