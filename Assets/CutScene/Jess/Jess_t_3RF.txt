[Jess4]
[Newln]*You run into Jessica as you walk into the bathroom.*
[Newln]Oh. It’s you.
[Newln]Don’t tell anybody, but I just made a girl cry in the bathroom.
[Newln]I just told her her dartplay is like art.
[Newln]*She gasps.*
[Newln]I might’ve said something other than art.
[Newln]*She stares at you for a second
[Newln]*Jessica burps.*
[Newln]Oh God.
[Newln]I’m going back inside. People can’t see me this drunk.
[Newln]*She grabs your arm and pulls you all the way into a stall.*
[Newln]Hold my hair please...
[Newln]*She vomits into the toilet.*
[Newln]This is your fault.
[Newln]Buying me drinks all night long.
	[Display]I didn’t force you to drink them. 
		[Answer][RaiseJessLove1]Semantics are fallacious, you know.
 [Display]I’m taking responsibility. 
	[Answer][RaiseJessLove2]I’d say you’re doing the bare minimum by being here.
[Display]You’re not enjoying this? 
	[Answer][RaiseJessLove3]*She laughs.*
	[Answer]I think you are scum, you know.
[Newln]*Jessica vomits again.*
[Newln]Just stay here for a little while longer.
[Newln]I have to say you are a lovely hair holder by the way.
[Newln]*You stay with Jessica for a while until she feels better.*[ResetIntoxJess]
