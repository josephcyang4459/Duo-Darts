<*Elaine is sitting at the bar.*
<*You sit next to her.*

<Im not really in the mood to put you down right now.
<Come back later.
	$Im staying.
		&*Elaine shakes her head in disbelief.
	$No.
		&*Elaine looks genuinely surprised at your response.*
	$Well if you say so... 
		&*Elaine grabs your arm before you can leave and makes you remain seated.*
<I dont know what sick game youve been playing all night spending time with me just to get treated poorly.
<But, it has gotten me thinking about what Im really doing to you.
<It's not been for good fun or some reason like that.
<I genuinely think of you as less than me at all levels.
<Thats what I think of everyone here.
<*Elaine looks at you with a look of concern.*
<Am I just a great dart player with no other redeeming qualities?
	$Yes. -Fail-
		&*Elaine looks disturbed.*
		&Just go away.
	$Youve been great. -Success-
		&*She looks dumbfounded.*
	$You have redeeming qualities. -Success-
		&*She looks at you like you just saved her life.
<You think so?
<After all the things Ive said to you?
<Its not just you either Im terrible to everyone.
<*You nod.*
<Wow.
<Youre the first person to be appreciative of me in
<I dont even know. Years maybe.
<*She grabs a dart from one of her pockets.*
<This is for you.
<Youre not a dog anymore.
<Youre someone worth my respect.
<*She smiles.*
<Sometimes
<You know.
<Id like to be your partner for the final round.
<Nobody else around here gets me like you do.
<*You spend some time with the now slightly more merciful goddess of darts.*
