[Newln]*You see Elaine throwing dart after dart at a board nearby.*
[Newln]Hey! Doggie!
[Newln]*She’s plastered.*
[Newln]Come here and look. Look at this trick.
[Newln]*Elaine sets up a throw with all three darts in hand.*
[Newln]*She throws all three at once. One hits the bullseye and the rest bounce off.*
[Newln]Come on!
[Newln]Hey, go stand in front of the board for me.
	[Display]Why?
		[Answer]Are you stupid?
	[Display]...
		[Answer][RaiseElaineLove2]Yes! The silence is so loud from you.
	[Display]*Walk over.*
		[Answer][RaiseElaineLove3]Good. Very good.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]Get in place.
[Newln]Now.
[Newln]*You stand in front of the board with your head covering most of it.*
[Newln]*A small crowd has gathered.*
[Newln]*You contemplate the actions that have led you to this moment.*
[Newln]So I just have to land these darts without disfiguring you.
[Newln]One next to each ear and one right above the head.
[Newln]Easy.
[Newln]*Elaine readies her three dart trick again.*
[Newln]*She throws. You close your eyes.*
[Newln]Yes! I did it!
[Newln]*The darts landed just as she had called.*
[Newln]Aren’t you impressed? I’m a real deal dart goddess.
[Newln]*The crowd claps and then they disperse.*
[Newln]Hey. 
[Newln]You weren’t worried were you?
[Newln]*She gives you a strangle-like hug.*
[Newln]This is your reward for intoxicating this goddess.
[Newln]Keep acting like that and you might just win my divine favor.
[Newln]*You spend some time getting a mix of praise and beration from Elaine.*[ResetElaineIntox]
