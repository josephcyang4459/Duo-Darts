[Newln]*Elaine is sitting at the bar.*
[Newln]*You sit next to her.*
[Newln]Oh. It’s you.
[Newln]I’m not really in the mood to put you down right now.
[Newln]Come back later.
	[Display]I’m staying.
		[Answer]*Elaine shakes her head in disbelief.
	[Display]No.
		[Answer]*Elaine looks genuinely surprised at your response.*
	[Display]Well if you say so... 
		[Answer]*Elaine grabs your arm before you can leave and makes you remain seated.*
[Newln]I don’t know what sick game you’ve been playing all night spending time with me just to get treated poorly.
[Newln]But, it has gotten me thinking about what I’m really doing to you.
[Newln]It's not been for good fun or some reason like that.
[Newln]I genuinely think of you as less than me at all levels.
[Newln]That’s what I think of everyone here.
[Newln]*Elaine looks at you with a look of concern.*
[Newln]Am I just a great dart player with no other redeeming qualities?
	[Display]Yes.
		[Answer]*Elaine looks disturbed.*
		[Answer]Just go away.
[Answer][ElaineFail][SceneExit]
	[Display]You’ve been great.
		[Answer][Elaine2]*She looks dumbfounded.*
	[Display][Elaine2]You have redeeming qualities.
		[Answer]*She looks at you like you just saved her life.
[Elaine1]
[ElaineSuccess]
[Newln]You think so?
[Newln]After all the things I’ve said to you?
[Newln]It’s not just you either, I'm terrible to everyone.
[Newln]*You nod.*
[Elaine2]
[Newln]Wow.
[Newln]You’re the first person to be appreciative of me in…
[Newln]I don’t even know. Maybe my whole life.
[Newln]*She grabs a dart from one of her pockets.*
[Newln]This is for you.
[Newln]You’re not beneath me anymore.
[Newln]You’re someone worth my respect.
[Newln]*She smiles.*
[Newln]Sometimes…
[Elaine1]
[Newln]You know.
[Newln]I’d like to be your partner for the final round.
[Newln]Nobody else around here gets me like you do.
[Newln]*You spend some time with the now slightly more merciful goddess of darts.*
