[Newln]*You walk up to Elaine who is again fidgeting with a few darts on the table in front of her.*
[Newln]Hey.
[Newln]Sit.
[Newln]I was thinking about the tournament.
[Newln]Is it really fair for me to even be here?
	[Display]Not even a little.
		[Answer][RaiseElaineLove3][Elaine2]My thoughts exactly.
	[Display]It’s fair.
		[Answer][Elaine3]Have you had your eyes closed all night?
		[Answer]I’m killing it.
	[Display]...
		[Answer][RaiseElaineLove2][Elaine2]*Elaine scoffs.*
		[Answer]You’re allowed to speak you know.

[Newln]This tournament bothers me.
[Newln]It’s a professional tournament, but it’s not enough for me.
[Newln]I want to go international.
[Newln]Bumming it in these bars and easily winning these tournaments is beneath me.
[Newln]*She pats your head.*
[Newln]And belittling underachievers like yourself has lost its charm.
[Newln]You know what, I have you to thank for this eureka.
[Newln]I really do owe you one.
[Newln]Anyways. Can you leave now?
[Newln]You honestly smell horrible and it’s definitely noticeable.
[Newln]*You leave Elaine to enjoy her fantasizations of international fame.*
