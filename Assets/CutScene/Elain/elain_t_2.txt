<*You walk up to Elaine who is again fidgeting with a few darts on the table in front of her.*
<Hey dog.
<Sit.
<I was thinking about the tournament.
<Is it really fair for me to even be here?
	$Not even a little. (+++)
		&My thoughts exactly.
	$Its fair.
		&Have you had your eyes closed all night?
		&Im killing it.
	$... (++)
		&*Elaine scoffs.*
		&Youre allowed to speak you know.
<This tournament bothers me.
<Its a professional tournament, but its not enough for me.
<I want to go international.
<Bumming it in these bars and easily winning these tournaments is beneath me.
<*She pats your head.*
<And belittling sadists like yourself has lost its charm.
<You know what, I have you to thank for this eureka.
<I really do owe you one.
<Anyways. Can you leave now?
<You honestly smell horrible and its definitely noticeable.
<*You leave Elaine to enjoy her fantasizations of international fame.*
