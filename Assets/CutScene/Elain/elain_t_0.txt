	$No (+)
		&Better to be confident and annoying than be a coward and annoying.
	$... (+++)
		&Well if youre gonna be good and keep your mouth shut Ill let you stay.
<You know what, you should stay.
<You seem fun to belittle.
<Especially since I have no clue who you are.
<*She stares at you for a second.*
<Hey. Name.
<*She hides a smile while you give your name.*
<Sorry, you just have the name of an amateur.
<Im Elaine Guzmn. Also known as the dart goddess.
<Any conceited idiot bold enough to say theyre the best hasnt met me yet.
<And now that I know your name I know for sure youre not even close to me.
<But, like I said, Ive been in the market for a punching bag.
<*You sit quietly as Elaine insults you for a while.*
