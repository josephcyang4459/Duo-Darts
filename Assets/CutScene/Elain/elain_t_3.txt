<*You see Elaine throwing dart after dart at a board nearby.*
<Hey! Doggie!
<*Shes plastered.*
<Come here and look. Look at this trick.
<*Elaine sets up a throw with all three darts in hand.*
<*She throws all three at once. One hits the bullseye and the rest bounce off.*
<Come on!
<Hey doggie go stand in front of the board for me.
	$Why?
		&Are you stupid?
	$... (++)
		&Yes! The silence is amazing.
	$Walk over. (+++)
		&Such a good dog.
<Get in place now.
<*You stand in front of the board with your head covering most of it.*
<*A small crowd has gathered.*
<*You contemplate the actions that have led you to this moment.*
<Ok I dont want to hurt my pet. So I just have to land these darts.
<One next to each ear and one right above the head.
<*Elaine readies her three dart trick again.*
<*She throws. You close your eyes.*
<Yes! I did it!
<*The darts landed just as she had called.*
<Arent you impressed? Im the real dart goddess.
<*The crowd claps and then they disperse.*
<Hey. You werent worried were you?
<*She gives you a hug.*
<That is your reward for intoxicating a goddess.
<Keep acting like this and you might just win my favor.
<*You spend some time getting a mix of praise and beration from the dart goddess.*
