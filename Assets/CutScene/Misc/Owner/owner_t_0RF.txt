[Newln]*You order a drink.*
[Newln]*The owner tending the bar strikes up a conversation with you.*
[Owner1]
[Newln]Have you seen the bathroom?
[Newln]You might be wondering why there’s only one.
[Newln]Thanks to the push for gender neutral bathrooms I had an incredible idea for the bar one day.
[Newln]If I have just a gender neutral bathroom that means I don’t have to waste money renovating two bathrooms AND a gender neutral bathroom.
[Newln]So I decided to only have a gender neutral bathroom and with the money I saved I made it an incredible bathroom.
[Newln]If only people didn’t scribble on the walls and vomit on the floor.
[Newln]I should’ve opened a family restaurant or something like that.
[Newln]Then my life would be perfect.
[Newln]Anyways. Enjoy your drink.
[Newln]*You spend time pondering the financial efficiency of supporting progressive views on gender.*[RaisePlayerIntox1]
