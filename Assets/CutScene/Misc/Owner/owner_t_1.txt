[Newln]*You order a drink.*
[Newln]*The owner tending the bar strikes up a conversation with you.*
[Owner1]
[Newln]You know, my wife threw a knife at me the other day.
[Newln]I thought it was wrong of her to do that, but then realized I forgot to do the dishes earlier that day.
[Newln]So I guess I had it coming.
[Newln]I love my wife so much.
[Newln]Anyways. Enjoy your drink.
[Newln]*You consider the possible benefits of remaining single over a cold drink.*[RaisePlayerIntox1]
