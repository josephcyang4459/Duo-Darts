[Newln]*You order a drink.*
[Newln]*The owner tending the bar strikes up a conversation with you.*
[Owner1]
[Newln]When they asked me to host this dart tournament I was a bit upset.
[Newln]Place was rented out to have a wedding today.
[Newln]So I had to tell them they couldn’t get married since the tournament organizers always pay me too much to pass up.
[Newln]Needless to say my daughter hasn’t spoken to me since.
[Newln]I even gave her the money back.
[Newln]Love her to bits, but she always overreacts to things like that.
[Newln]Anyways. Enjoy your drink.[RaisePlayerIntox1]
