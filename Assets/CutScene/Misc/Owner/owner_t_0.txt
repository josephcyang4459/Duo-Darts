<*You order a drink.*
<*The owner tending the bar strikes up a conversation with you.*
<Have you seen the bathroom?
<You might be wondering why theres only one.
<Thanks to the push for gender neutral bathrooms I had an incredible idea for the bar one day.
<If I have just a gender neutral bathroom that means I dont have to waste money renovating two bathrooms AND a gender neutral bathroom.
<So I decided to only have a gender neutral bathroom and with the money I saved I made it an incredible bathroom.
<If only people wouldnt draw on the walls and vomit on the floor.
<I shouldve opened a family restaurant or something like that. Then my life would be perfect.
<Anyways. Enjoy your drink.
<*You spend time pondering the financial efficiency of supporting progressive views on gender.*
