<*THIS SCENE IS PLACED INCORRECTLY THIS IS FIXED WITH THE REFACTORED TXT FILES
<*A young woman is the culprit. She kneels down next to you and sits you up.*
<Here, that looks painful.
<*She grabs a drink from her table and puts the cold glass onto your forehead.*
<For the swelling.
<*The woman tending your blunder looks away whenever you look at her face.*
<*Something about her face is catching your attention.*
	$Youre a beautiful woman. (+++)
		&*A heavy blush covers her surprised face.*
	$Youre a man?
		&Shh! No talking, you're making a scene.
	$What are you looking at? (+)
&You mustve really hit your head hard.	
<*She helps you off the ground onto your feet.*	
<Just come sit with me for a minute to relax.
<*You sit in the booth.*
<*She sighs and moves further into the shadow of the booth.*
<Everyones looking this way now because of you.
<You have any idea how stressful it can be?
<*You stare blankly at her.*
<Transitioning I mean.
<Im a woman. Or, you know, transitioned to a woman if that makes more sense to you.
	$Makes sense to me. (++)
		&That saves me the trouble of having to explain.
	$Wait so... 
		&Oh my God. I was a man and now Im a woman.
		&Whats so complicated about it?
	$...(+)
		&Please stop staring already... 
<Anyway. My tournament name is Faybian Artel.
<Call me Faye though please.
<I just havent found the time to legally change it.
<*Faye motions away from the booth.*
<Come back later. People have their eyes on you and it's bothering me.
<*You leave Faye to her booth.*
