[Newln]*A sketchy looking man motions to a seat next to him at a table.
[Newln]Yo. Sit.
[Newln]*You sit.*
[Newln]These fools. They just don’t get the art of the dart, you know?
[Newln]But you... I can tell you’re from a different flock.
[Newln]You understand.
[Newln]*He pats your back a little too hard.*
[Newln]You’re the right stuff.
[Newln]I’ll be cheering for you.
[Newln]And I’ll even give you some free advice.
[Newln]When going for a high ton, always think about cargo ships.
[Newln]Those babies can hold so many tons of darts. It’s incredible.
[Newln]Not that you needed that advice, but now you have it.
[Newln]*He pats your back even harder.*
[Newln]Off you go. To victory and triumph.
[Newln]*You leave your seat feeling motivated by the art of the dart.*[RaisePlayerSkill1]
