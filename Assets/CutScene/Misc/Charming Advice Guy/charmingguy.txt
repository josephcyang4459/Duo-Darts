<Come sit with me.
<Let me tell you something about relationships.
<*He leans back confidently.*
<With this one easy step you can get anyone to fall for you.
<All you have to do is be better than you were yesterday.
<Eventually youll be so incredible that if someone doesnt fall for you theyd be stupid.
<Thats what I did.
<Havent you already fallen for me?
<*You get up without saying a word.*
<*After finding another seat far away from the man you consider if you are better than you were yesterday.*
