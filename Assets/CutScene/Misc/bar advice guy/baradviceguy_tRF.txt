[Newln]*You sit next to a man at the bar.*
[BarAdviceGuy0]
[Newln]*He begins talking to you without prompting.*
[Newln]My boyfriend, who was also my darts partner, left me because I’m bad at darts.
[Newln]*He looks at you with passion.*
[Newln]I will not let you fail like I have.
[Newln]My best advice for you to avoid my fate is to compliment something about your darts partner before every game.
[Newln]It’ll make them more confident. And you’ll feel better about yourself.
[Newln]Speaking of which, I’m gonna go cry in a bathroom stall to make myself feel better.
[Newln]Good luck in the tournament.
[Newln]*He leaves you to contemplate the fickle nature of love and darts over a cold drink.*[RaisePlayerIntox1][RaisePlayerSkill1]
