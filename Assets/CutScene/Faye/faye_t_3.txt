<*You walk up to Fayes booth, but shes not there.
<*Suddenly you feel a pull on your leg.*
<Hey. Down here.
<*You look down to see Faye hiding underneath the table.*
<Come down here. Its so nice down here.
<*You find yourself huddled with Faye underneath the table.*
<*She has lined empty glasses along the wall.*
<*The total is staggering.*
<Look! My masterpiece.
<Isnt it beautiful.
	$Totally. (++)
		&You're too sweet.
	$If I look at it this way... (+)
		&*Faye rolls her eyes.*
		&Oh my God.
		&The fact I can even stack them while this drunk means I deserve an award.
	$I could do better. (+++)
		&*Faye pouts*
		&Youre so cruel.
<Id like to dedicate my masterpiece to this jerk.
<*Faye points to you while holding one of the glasses like a microphone.*
<Without them Id never have gotten this drunk.
<They are my inspiration.
<*You spend some time attending Fayes imaginary award ceremony under the table.*
