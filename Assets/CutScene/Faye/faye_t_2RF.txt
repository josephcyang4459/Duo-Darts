[Newln]*You see Faye at the bar.*
[Newln]*The owner is talking with her while she orders a drink.*
[Newln]*You move closer to hear what they’re saying.*
[Owner1]
[Newln]Faybian right?
[Faye1]
[Newln]Umm, it’s actually Faye now.
[Owner1]
[Newln]It’s easier for me to call you Faybian though.
[Newln]I’ve known you as Faybian for years. 
[Newln]Can’t I just call you that?
[Newln]*You walk up to the conversation.*
[Faye2]
[Newln]It’s you.
[Owner1]
[Newln]Can I get you something?
	[Display]Whatever she ordered. 
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Sure. I’ll grab that for you.
		[Answer]*The owner turns around to prepare the drink.*
	[Display]Just fetching Faye. 
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove3]*The owner places Faye’s drink in front of her and moves to the next customer.*
	[Display]No I’m good.
		[Answer]Sounds good.
		[Answer]Anyways.
		[Answer]*Before he can continue his previous thought, another customer calls him over.*
		[Answer]Excuse me.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye grabs your arm with one hand and grabs her drink with the other. Leading you back to her lounge booth.*
[Lounge]
[Newln]*You both sit down in the booth.*
[Newln]*Faye looks irritated.*
[Faye3]
[Newln]I hate this league. No matter who I talk to, it's always the same question.
[Newln]Like, do they think they can just determine who I am and I just have to deal with that?
[Faye1]
[Newln]*She sighs and drinks.*
[Newln]Maybe I should just quit and go somewhere else.
[Newln]Where nobody knew me before.
	[Display]Maybe.
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]*She frowns.*
		[Answer]I hate ‘maybe’s’.
	[Answer]Is it really that bad?
		[Answer][Faye3]Yes.
	[Answer]Screw that.
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove2][Faye2]*Faye smiles lightly.*
		[Answer]I’m a darts player first after all.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye becomes recomposed.*
[Newln]I’ll keep going. Things will get better.
[Newln]I love this game too much.
[Newln]Thanks for getting me away from that idiot by the way.
[Newln]*You spend some time with Faye in her booth.*
