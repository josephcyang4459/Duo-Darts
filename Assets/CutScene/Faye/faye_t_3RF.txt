[Newln]*You walk up to Faye’s booth, but she’s not there.
[Newln]*Suddenly, you feel a pull on your leg.*
[Faye4]
[Newln]Hey. Down here.
[Newln]*You look down to see Faye hiding underneath the table.*
[Newln]Come down here.
[Newln]It’s so nice down here.
[Newln]*You find yourself huddled with Faye underneath the table.*
[Newln]*She has lined empty glasses along the wall.*
[Newln]*The total is staggering.*
[Newln]Look! My masterpiece.
[Newln]Isn’t it beautiful?
	[Display]Totally. [RaiseFayeLove2]
		[Answer]You're too sweet.
	[Display]If I look at it this way... 
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]*Faye rolls her eyes.*
		[Answer]Oh my God.
		[Answer]The fact I can even stack them while this drunk I think I deserve an award.
	[Display]I could do better.
		[Answer][RaiseLove3]*Faye pouts*
		[Answer]You’re so cruel.
[Newln]I’d like to dedicate my masterpiece to this jerk.
[Newln]*Faye points to you while holding one of the glasses like a microphone.*
[Newln]Without them I’d never have gotten this drunk.
[Newln]They are my inspiration.
[Newln]And I’d also like to thank…
[Newln]*She pauses, lost in thought.*
[Newln]What was their name?
[Newln]*You spend some time attending Faye’s imaginary award ceremony under the table.*[ResetFayeIntox]
