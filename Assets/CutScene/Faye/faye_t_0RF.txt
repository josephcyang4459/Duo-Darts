[Newln]*While walking past a booth you accidentally trip on someone’s leg. You fall face first onto the ground.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*A young woman is the culprit. She kneels down next to you and sits you up.*
[Newln]Here, that looks painful.
[Newln]*She grabs a drink from her table and puts the cold glass onto your forehead.*
[Newln]For the swelling.
[Newln]*The woman tending your blunder looks away whenever you look at her face.*
[Newln]*Something about her face is catching your attention.*
	[Display]You’re a beautiful woman. 
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove3]*A heavy blush covers her face.*
	[Display]You’re a man?
		[Answer][Faye3]*She casts a disapproving face.*
	[Display]What are you looking at?
[Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Umm, nothing.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*She helps you off the ground onto your feet.*	
[Newln]Just come sit with me for a minute to recover.
[Newln]*You sit in the booth.*
[Newln]*You notice the upholstery to be only average in quality.*
[Newln]*The woman sighs and moves further into the shadow of the booth.*
[Newln]Everyone’s looking this way now because of you.
[Newln]I wish this was easier…
[Newln]*You stare blankly at her.*
[Newln]You’re new aren’t you.
[Newln]Well I’ll tell you since everyone else knows anyway.
[Newln]I’m a woman. Or, you know, transitioned to a woman if that makes more sense to you.
	[Display]Makes sense to me.
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove2][Faye2]That saves me the trouble of having to explain.
	[Display]Wait so... 
		[Answer][Faye3]That reaction is the worst. Why’s it so hard to understand?
	[Display]...
		[Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Please stop staring already... 
[Faye1]
[Newln]Anyway. My tournament name is Faybian Artel.
[Newln]Call me Faye though please.
[Newln]I just haven’t found the time to legally change it.
[Newln]*She bumps her head against the back of the booth in a small concession.*
[Newln]Or the money…
[Newln]It’s not cheap doing this.
[Newln]*Faye motions away from the booth.*
[Newln]If you’re interested in talking then come back later.
[Newln]People have their eyes on you and it's bothering me.
[Newln]Sorry.
[Newln]*You leave Faye to her booth.*
[Newln]*You notice how hard it is to see her even just a few feet away from the booth.*
