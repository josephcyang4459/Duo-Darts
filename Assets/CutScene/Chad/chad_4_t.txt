<*You hear someone vomiting in the stall*
<Oh god...
<*Its Chads voice.*
<Its you isnt it?
<Dont let anyone else into the bathroom.
<I came in here to relax for a minute and the pressure got to me.
<If anyone else finds out about this my reputation will be destroyed.
<*Chad sniffles and spits into the toilet.*
<I dont think I can win.
	$But youre Chadrick Basedman.
		&Dont give me that line.
		&You didnt even know or care who I was until today.
	$Youre right.
		&For a second I thought you wouldnt kick me while Im down.
		&But maybe I deserve it...
	$...
		&Come on.
		&Arent you going to motivate me?
<Its no use.
<No matter what anyone does or says to me Id still be the one who needed someone else.
<*Chad hits the stall wall.*
<And that is just unacceptable!
	$So what? -Fail-
		&Just leave me.
		&*You leave* -Scene ends-
	$Just get up. -Success-
		&*Chad laughs.*
	$Then do it yourself. -Success-
		&No.
		&I cant.
<*Chad flushes the toilet.*
<Were at a duos tournament you know.
<*Chad emerges from the stall with regained composure.*
<I need you.
<And Im ok with that if it means I can win.
<Please. 
<Let me be your partner for the final round.
<You dont have to answer right now, but thank you for being here either way.
<*Chad walks past you out of the bathroom.*
