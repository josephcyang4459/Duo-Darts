[Newln]*You hear someone vomiting in the stall*
[Chad1]
[Newln]Oh god...
[Newln]*It’s Chad’s voice.*
[Newln]It’s you isn’t it?
[Newln]Don’t let anyone else into the bathroom.
[Newln]I came in here to relax for a minute and the pressure got to me.
[Newln]If anyone else finds out about this my reputation will be destroyed.
[Newln]*Chad sniffles and spits into the toilet.*
[Newln]I don’t think I can win.
	[Display]But you’re Chadrick Basedman.
		[Answer]Don’t give me that line.
		[Answer]You didn’t even know or care who I was until today.
	[Display]You’re right.
		[Answer]For a second I thought you wouldn’t kick me while I’m down.
		[Answer]But maybe I deserve it...
	[Display]...
		[Answer]Come on.
		[Answer]Aren’t you going to motivate me?
[Newln]It’s no use.
[Newln]No matter what anyone does or says to me I’d still be the one who needed someone else.
[Newln]*Chad hits the stall wall.*
[Newln]And that is just unacceptable!
	[Display]So what?
		[Answer][Chad3]I knew you wouldn’t get it.
[Answer]Just leave me.
[Answer]*You leave like he asked.*
[Answer][ChadFail][SceneExit]
	[Display]Just get up.
		[Answer][Chad2]*Chad laughs.*
	[Display]Then do it yourself.
		[Answer][Chad2]No.
		[Answer]I can’t.
[Newln]*Chad flushes the toilet.*

[ChadSuccess]
[Newln]We’re at a duo’s tournament, you know.
[Newln]*Chad emerges from the stall with regained composure.*
[Newln]I need you.
[Newln]And I’m ok with that if it means I can win.
[Newln]We can win.
[Newln]*Chadrick lowers his head and gets down onto one knee before you.*
[Newln]*He raises his face to reveal the most chiseled and perfectly conformed facial expression you’ve ever seen.*
[Newln]Please. 
[Newln]Let me be your partner for the final round.
[Chad2]
[Newln]You don’t have to answer right now, but thank you for being here either way.
[Chad1]
[Newln]*Chad gets up and walks past you out of the bathroom.*
[Newln]*He didn’t wash his hands…*
