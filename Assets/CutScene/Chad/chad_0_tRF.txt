[Newln]*A man stops you and gets a clear look at your face.*
[Chad1]
[Newln]Haven’t met you before. Who’re you?
[Newln]Hmm…
[Newln]I can’t remember meeting anyone with your name.
[Newln]You must be nobody then. For now at least.
[Newln]Well you’re here so I suppose you can’t be that terrible.
[Newln]Take a seat. 
[Newln]So. Tell me more about yourself.
	[Display]Umm, who are you?
		[Answer][RaiseChadLove3][Chad2]A bold question. I like that.
	[Display]I’m the best.
		[Answer]If only the best wasn’t already sitting in front of you I might’ve believed that.
	[Display]...
		[Answer][RaiseChadLove2][Chad2]I see. You want your play to prove yourself? I respect that.
[Chad1]
[Newln]Well, you've piqued my interest for better or worse. 
[Newln]You should already know my name, but I’m Chadrick Basedman.
[Newln]*When he says his name he seems to warp his face in a way that highlights his incredible facial features.*
[Newln]Let me ask you a few more questions.
[Newln]*Momentarily mesmerized you spend a while talking with Chadrick answering questions.*
