[Newln]*Chadrick is dancing…*
[Newln]*He’s clearly obliterated…*
[Chad4]
[Newln]Hey, it's you.
[Newln]Impressed? You should be.
[Newln]I’ve got moves.
[Newln]I think…
[Newln]*He stares intently at you for a second.*
[Newln]You. Me. Dance. Now.

[Newln]*Chad grabs your arm and dances with you for a time.*
[Newln]Hey you’re pretty good at this.

[Newln]I owe you one.
[Newln]If you’re lucky that is.
[Newln]*You and Chad dance away. He trips up often.*[ResetIntoxChad]
