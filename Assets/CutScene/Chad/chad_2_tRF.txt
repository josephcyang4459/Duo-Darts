[Newln]*You approach Chad watching people dance from the sidelines.*
[Newln]*He notices you and nods.*
[Newln]You need something?
	[Display]Want to dance? 
		[Answer][RaiseChadLove3]*Chad scoffs.*
		[Answer][Chad2]You wish.
	[Display]?
		[Answer][RaiseChadLove2]*Chad nods.*
		[Answer][Chad2]I agree. It’s ridiculous.
	[Display]Just observing.
		[Answer][RaiseChadLove1]*Chad Chuckles.*
		[Answer]Me or the dancing?
[Chad1]
[Newln]Even outside of a tournament I’m not a fan of dancing.
[Newln]It must just give good players something to do while they wait for the final call.
[Newln]Speaking of which.
[Newln]Do you think you can win this thing?
	[Display]Yeah.
		[Answer][RaiseChadLove1][Chad2]Maybe if I were your partner.
	[Display]No.
		[Answer]I know I’m here, but you could still get second place if you weren’t so pessimistic.
	[Display]I’m not sure.
		[Answer][RaiseChadLove1]I can’t tell if you’re being pessimistic or humble…

[Newln]Let me give you some free advice.
[Newln]You’ll need some good luck with this crowd.
[Newln]*Chadrick raises an eyebrow and smirks.*
[Newln]And against me of course.
[Newln]I always find myself a bit luckier after taking a second in the bathroom to calm down.
[Newln]And if you’re tipsy you might sober up a bit from the chill in there.
[Newln]That’s my advice.
[Newln]Anyways, I have a few more questions for you.
[Newln]*You and Chad spend time talking.*
[Newln]*His questions are more personal this time around.*
