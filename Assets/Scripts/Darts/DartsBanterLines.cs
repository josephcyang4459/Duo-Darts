i figure it would randomly read off lines. though we should not let lines be read off twice within on game of darts.
    also a banter line doesn't need to read off every single time. 
    Only for special ones, like getting 0 or getting 180 should always have a line be read of (unless there are no 'fresh' lines remaining within the case). 
    The other cases can have a chance to read of a line (60/40 favoring reading off a line)
