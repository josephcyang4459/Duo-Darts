Scene One (Lounge) (0 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*A man with intense, striking features catches your attention. He catches the glance, motioning you to come closer.*
[Chad1]
[Newln]Haven't met you before. Who're you?
[Newln]Hmm...
[Newln]I can't remember meeting anyone with your name.
[Newln]You must be nobody then. For now at least. Don't worry, even I started from the bottom.
[Chad2]
[Newln]That and you're here so I suppose you've got to have some potential.
[Newln]Take a seat.
[Chad1]
[Newln]So. Tell me more about yourself.
        [Display]Should I know you already?
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove3][Chad2]A bold question. I like that.
        [Display]I'm the best.
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove1]If only the best wasn't already sitting in front of you I might've believed that.
        [Display]...
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove2][Chad2]I see. You want your play to prove yourself? I respect that.
[Chad1]
[Newln]Well, you've piqued my interest for better or worse. 
[Newln]You really should already know my name, but I'm Chadrick Basedman.
[Chad2]
[Newln]*When he says his name he seems to warp his face in a way that highlights his incredible facial features.*
[Newln]Let me ask you a few more questions.
[Newln]*Momentarily mesmerized you spend a while listening to Chadrick.*
[Newln]*Despite saying he would ask you questions, he finds ways to bring himself up more than anything.*


Scene Two (Before a game of darts) (1 Love) (Refactored)
[Chad1]
[Newln]I can't say I've always been the one to give an upstart a chance.
[Newln]Then again, great men can always be greater, so I'll call this a social experiment for myself.
[Newln]Nothing more and nothing less.
[Newln]And you better hold up your end of the game.
[Newln]Not that I would need your points. I could check out alone if they'd let me.
        [Display]Cocky much?
                [Answer]That's right. You still haven't seen how good I really am.
        [Display]I'd love to see a legend in action.
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove2][Chad2]Blatant flattery will get you somewhere, but not as far as you might hope.
        [Display]Underestimating me?
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove3][Chad2]Just throw your darts.
[Chad1]
[Newln]Now, we're up.
[Newln]Let's see what you've got.


Scene Three (Dance floor) (6 Love) (Refactored)
[Chad1]
[Newln]*You approach Chad watching people dance from the sidelines.*
[Newln]*He notices you and nods.*
[Newln]You need something?
        [Display]Want to dance? 
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove3]*Chad scoffs.*
                [Answer][Chad2]You wish.
        [Display]Just avoiding dancing.
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove2]*Chad nods.*
                [Answer][Chad2]I agree. It's ridiculous.
        [Display]Just observing.
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove1]*Chad Chuckles.*
                [Answer][Chad2]Me or the dancing?
[Chad1]
[Newln]Even outside of a tournament I'm not a fan of dancing.
[Newln]I think it just gives good players something to do while they wait for the final call.
[Newln]Speaking of which.
[Newln]Do you think you have what it takes to win this whole thing?
        [Display]Yeah.
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove1][Chad2]Maybe if I were your partner.
        [Display]No.
                [Answer]I know I'm here, but you could still get second place if you weren't so pessimistic.
        [Display]I'm not sure.
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove1]I can't tell if you're being pessimistic or humble...
[Chad1]
[Newln]Let me give you some free advice.
[Newln]You'll need some good luck with this crowd.
[Chad2]
[Newln]*Chadrick raises an eyebrow and smirks.*
[Newln]And against me of course.
[Newln]I always find myself a bit luckier after taking a second in the bathroom to calm down.
[Chad1]
[Newln]And if you're tipsy you might just sober up a bit from the chill in there.
[Newln]Not that I'd know from personal experience.
[Chad2]
[Newln]I hold my drinks better than anyone
[Chad1]
[Newln]But, for the average person, that's my advice.
[Newln]Anyways, I have a few more questions for you.
[Newln]*You and Chad spend time talking.*
[Newln]*Unlike before, he focuses the conversation on you. His questions are irrelevant to darts, mostly about your life outside the game.*




Scene Four Optional (Dance floor) - Requires drunk Chad (10 Love) (Removes all Intox) (Refactored)
[Newln]*Chadrick is dancing...*
[Newln]*He's clearly obliterated...*
[Chad4]
[Newln]Hey, it's you.
[Newln]Impressed? You should be.
[Newln]I've got moves.
[Newln]I think...
[Newln]*He stares intently at you for a second.*
[Newln]You. Me. Dance. Now.
        [Display]Yes.
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove3]I was hoping you'd say that.
        [Display]Nope.
                [Answer]It wasn't a question.
        [Display]...
                [Answer][RaiseChadLove2]Do I have to do all the work around here?
[Newln]*Chad grabs your arm and dances with you for a time.*
[Newln]Hey you're pretty good at this.
[Newln]To think if you hadn't drowned me at the bar I'd never get this chance.
[Newln]I owe you one.
[Newln]If you're lucky that is.
[Newln]*You and Chad dance away. He trips up often.*[ResetIntoxChad]




Scene Five (Bathroom) (13 Love)
[Newln]*You hear someone vomiting in the stall*
[Chad1]
[Newln]Oh god...
[Newln]*It's Chad's voice.*
[Newln]It's you isn't it?
[Newln]Don't let anyone else into the bathroom.
[Newln]I came in here to relax for a minute and the pressure got to me.
[Newln]If anyone else finds out about this my reputation will be destroyed.
[Newln]*Chad sniffles and spits into the toilet.*
[Newln]I don't think I can win.
        [Display]But you're Chadrick Basedman.
                [Answer]Don't give me that line.
                [Answer]You didn't even know or care who I was until today.
        [Display]You're right.
                [Answer]For a second I thought you wouldn't kick me while I'm down.
                [Answer]But maybe I deserve it...
        [Display]...
                [Answer]Come on.
                [Answer]Aren't you going to motivate me?
[Newln]It's no use.
[Newln]No matter what anyone does or says to me I'd still be the one who needed someone else.
[Newln]*Chad hits the stall wall.*
[Newln]And that is just unacceptable.
        [Display]So what?
                [Answer][Chad3]I knew you wouldn't get it.
[Answer]Just leave me.
[Answer]*You leave like he asked.*
[Answer][ChadFail][SceneExit]
        [Display]Just get up.
                [Answer][Chad2]*Chad laughs.*
        [Display]Then do it yourself.
                [Answer][Chad2]No.
                [Answer]I can't.
[Newln]*Chad flushes the toilet.*
[Chad1]
[ChadSuccess]
[Newln]We're at a duo's tournament, you know.
[Newln]*Chad emerges from the stall with regained composure.*
[Newln]I need you.
[Newln]And I'm ok with that if it means I can win.
[Newln]We can win.
[Newln]*Chadrick lowers his head and gets down onto one knee before you.*
[Chad2]
[Newln]*He raises his face to reveal the most chiseled and perfectly conformed facial expression you've ever seen.*
[Newln]Please. 
[Newln]Let me be your partner for the final round.
[Newln]You don't have to answer right now, but thank you for being here either way.
[Chad1]
[Newln]*Chad gets up and walks past you out of the bathroom.*
[Newln]*He didn't wash his hands...*




Intermediate Scene Dance Floor (Repeating) (1 Love)
[Newln]*You join Chad in people watching.*
[Chad1]
[Newln]Always fun to watch.
[Newln]Anyways, got time for a few questions?
[Newln]*You spend time talking with Chad.*
[Newln]*He seems to value the company.*[RaiseChadLove2]


Intermediate Scene Dance Floor (Repeating) (1 Love) (+Intoxication)
[Newln]*You join Chad in people watching.*
[Chad1]
[Newln]Drinking?
[Newln]I can say for sure that's better than dancing.
[Newln]If you're paying I'll have a few.
[Newln]*You spend time drinking with Chad.*[RaiseChadLove1][RaiseChadIntox1][RaisePlayerIntox1]


Banter Lines (During Darts)
[0]I wish I had looked away from that.
[0]There's the best and then there's the worst.
[Below70]Effort makes results, you know.
[Below70]Happens to everyone, they say.
[Highton]A score like that never loses its luster.
[Highton]I'm in good company, it seems.
[Highton]I'm impressed.
[Highton]Near perfect.
[180]Finally, good company.
[180]I had a feeling you had that in you.
[180]I have to return some videotapes.
[Checkout]I had no doubts.
[Checkout]From the first dart, I knew it was set and done.
[Checkout]I hope my score didn't make you uncomfortable.






Banter Lines Finals (During Darts Finals)
[0Final]Don't back out on me now. I know you have it in you.
[Below70Final]We both know you can be the best. Time to do it.
[Below70Final]Greatness won't wait, chase it.
[LowtonFinal]One leg at a time. This one's ours.
[LowtonFinal]
[HightonFinal]They'll remember your name if you keep that up.
[HightonFinal]I can barely keep up with you.
[HightonFinal]You're making the other teams nervous. Incredible.
[HightonFinal]You're making me look like an amateur.
[HightonFinal]There's always a bigger fish, it seems.
[180Final]You're psychotic with those darts.
[180Final]More stunning than me...
[180Final]An inspiration...
[CheckoutFinal]There's never been greatness like ours.
[CheckoutFinal]Perfection. I knew you were the right choice.
[CheckoutFinal]To think I almost missed out on this. Thank you.




Final Scene
[Newln]*You did it.*
[Newln]*You see Chad wasted no time preparing himself for pictures.*
[Newln]*He waits for you next to the trophy.*
[Chad2]
[Newln]Come on, this trophy is as much mine as it is yours.
[Newln]*You place a hand on one side and you both hoist it high above you.*
[Newln]*You mostly lose your grip on it due to Chad's incredible height and wingspan.*
[Newln]Oh, apologies.
[Newln]*He lowers it, just, letting you get your grip back.*
[Newln]*Cameras flash and catch your shared pose.*
[Newln]*You notice more flashes land on Chad than yourself.*
[Newln]Well, that's not quite right.
[Newln]*He switches your pose, dragging you next to him with his arm around you.*
[Newln]You're fit for the cameras too. You are no one no more.
[Newln]We're the best. There's no other way to see it.
[Newln]*Soon, the flashes stop and people start to flock around the place at random.*
[Newln]They'll know your name now.
[Newln]Who knows, maybe your name will be known even more than mine.
[Newln]Surprisingly, I don't think that would bother me at all.
[Newln]If you hadn't come tonight I'm not sure I would've even been standing here.
[Newln]I wanted to walk out earlier, but you kept me on the path.
[Newln]*You see the tiniest drop of a tear form on the corner of his eye.*
[Newln]Please, take this.
[Newln]It's the least I can offer.
[Newln]*He extends his hand out toward you, offering one of his darts to you.*
[Newln]I've got to get going. You know, my life is a fast one.
[Newln]But rest assured, I'll never forget your name.
[Newln]*He shares one last incredible smile, framed to perfection by his features.*
[Newln]Until the next tournament.
[Newln]*He takes his leave and the trophy along with him.*
[Newln]*You examine the dart he gave you.*
[Newln]*You're not sure when he did, but he marked one of the fins with your first initial.*


Faye/Faybian Artel (Faye)


Scene One (Lounge) (0 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*While walking past a booth, you accidentally trip on someone's leg. You fall face first onto the ground.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*A young woman is the culprit. She kneels down next to you and sits you up.*
[Newln]Ugh, me and my long legs. Here, that looks painful.
[Newln]*She grabs a drink from her table and puts the cold glass onto your forehead.*
[Newln]For the swelling.
[Newln]*The woman tending your blunder looks away whenever you look at her face.*
[Newln]*Something about her face is catching your attention.*
        [Display]You're a beautiful woman. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove3][Faye2]*A heavy blush covers her face.*
        [Display]You're a man?
                [Answer][Faye3]*She casts a disapproving face.*
        [Display]What are you looking at?
[Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Umm, nothing.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*She helps you off the ground onto your feet.*        
[Newln]Just come sit with me for a minute to recover.
[Newln]*You sit in the booth.*
[Newln]*You notice the upholstery to be only average in quality.*
[Newln]*The woman sighs and moves further into the shadow of the booth.*
[Newln]Everyone's looking this way now because of you.
[Newln]Well, really it's my fault. Should've watched my reach.
[Newln]I wish this was easier...
[Newln]*You stare blankly at her, a look lacking context.*
[Newln]You're new aren't you.
[Newln]Well I'll tell you since everyone else knows anyway.
[Newln]I'm a woman. Or, you know, transitioned to a woman if that makes more sense to you.
        [Display]Makes sense to me.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove2][Faye2]That saves me the trouble of having to explain.
        [Display]Wait so... 
                [Answer][Faye3]That reaction is the worst. Why's it so hard to understand?
        [Display]...
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Please stop staring already... 
[Faye1]
[Newln]Anyway. My tournament name is Faybian Artel.
[Newln]Call me Faye though please.
[Newln]I just haven't found the time to legally change it.
[Newln]*She bumps her head against the back of the booth in a small concession.*
[Newln]Or the money...
[Newln]It's not cheap doing this.
[Newln]*Faye motions away from the booth.*
[Newln]If you're interested in talking then come back later.
[Newln]People have their eyes on you and it's bothering me.
[Newln]Sorry.
[Newln]*You leave Faye to her booth.*
[Newln]*You notice how hard it is to see her even just a few feet away from the booth.*




Scene Two (Darts) (1 Love) (Refactored)
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye looks nervous.*
[Newln]Make your turns quick please.
[Newln]I don't like being up and about, especially with a crowd.
[Newln]And yeah, I was meaning to ask if you ever attended any other tournaments.
[Newln]You didn't look familiar, but people don't always look the same from one meet to the next.
        [Display]I stick to the shadows.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove3][Faye2]Same.
                [Answer]We must've just missed each other then.
        [Display]I'm a regular. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Really?
                [Answer]I've seen just about everyone here before.
        [Display]This is my first one. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove2]Oh I see.
                [Answer][Faye2]Don't worry. You'll probably do ok.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye focuses up.*
[Newln]I apologize in advance that I'm not the best player here. 
[Newln]Here, you go first.




Scene Three (Bar) (8 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You see Faye at the bar.*
[Newln]*The owner is talking with her while she orders a drink.*
[Newln]*You move closer to hear what they're saying.*
[Owner1]
[Newln]Going on your tab, right Fabyian?
[Faye1]
[Newln]Umm, it's actually Faye now.
[Owner1]
[Newln]It's easier for me to call you Faybian though.
[Newln]I've known that name for years. You and my daughter have been friends since you were little, you know.
[Newln]Can't I just call you that?
[Newln]*You walk up to the conversation.*
[Faye2]
[Newln]*Faye notices you, looking over.*
[Newln]It's you.
[Owner1]
[Newln]Can I get you something?
        [Display]Whatever she ordered. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Sure. I'll grab that for you.
                [Answer]*The owner turns around to prepare the drink.*
        [Display]Just fetching Faye. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove3]*The owner places Faye's drink in front of her and moves to the next customer.*
        [Display]No I'm good.
                [Answer]Sounds good.
                [Answer]Anyways.
                [Answer]*Before he can continue his previous thought, another customer calls him over.*
                [Answer]Excuse me.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye grabs your arm with one hand and grabs her drink with the other. Leading you back to her lounge booth.*
[AreaLounge]
[Newln]*You both sit down in the booth.*
[Faye3]
[Newln]*Faye looks irritated.*
[Newln]I hate this league. No matter who I talk to, it's always the same question.
[Newln]Like, do they think they can just determine who I am and I just have to deal with that?
[Faye1]
[Newln]*She sighs and drinks.*
[Newln]Maybe I should just quit and go somewhere else.
[Newln]Where nobody knew me before.
        [Display]Maybe.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]*She frowns.*
                [Answer]I hate ‘maybe's'.
        [Answer]Is it really that bad?
                [Answer][Faye3]Yes.
        [Answer]Screw that.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove2][Faye2]*Faye smiles lightly.*
                [Answer]I'm a darts player first after all.
[Faye1]
[Newln]I worry too much about it. It's almost obsessive.
[Newln]I think I'm better off just being who I am.
[Newln]It's time to get over worrying about all the little things that come with that.
[Newln]*Faye becomes recomposed.*
[Newln]I'll keep going. Things will get better.
[Faye2]
[Newln]I love this game too much.
[Newln]Thanks for helping get me away from that idiot by the way.
[Newln]*You spend some time with Faye in her booth.*




Scene Four Optional (Lounge) Requires Drunk Faye (13 Love)  (Removes all Intox) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You walk up to Faye's booth, but she's not there.
[Newln]*Suddenly, you feel a pull on your leg.*
[Faye4]
[Newln]Hey. Down here.
[Newln]*You look down to see Faye hiding underneath the table.*
[Newln]Come down here.
[Newln]It's so nice down here.
[Newln]*You find yourself huddled with Faye underneath the table.*
[Newln]*She has lined empty glasses along the wall.*
[Newln]*The total is staggering.*
[Newln]Look! My masterpiece.
[Newln]Isn't it beautiful?
        [Display]It's artwork. [RaiseFayeLove2]
                [Answer]You're too sweet.
        [Display]If I look at it this way... 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]*Faye rolls her eyes.*
                [Answer]Oh my god.
                [Answer]The fact I can even stack them while this drunk I think I deserve an award.
        [Display]I could do better.
                [Answer][RaiseLove3]*Faye pouts*
                [Answer]You're so cruel.
[Newln]*She sways a bit, but then she straightens herself out.*
[Newln]I'd like to dedicate my masterpiece to this jerk.
[Newln]*Faye points to you while holding one of the glasses like a microphone.*
[Newln]Without them I'd never have gotten this drunk.
[Newln]They are my inspiration.
[Newln]And I'd also like to thank...
[Newln]*She pauses, lost in thought.*
[Newln]What was their name?
[Newln]*You spend some time attending Faye's imaginary award ceremony under the table.*[ResetFayeIntox]




Scene Five (Darts) (17 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You see Faye watching some other players.*
[Newln]*She waves you over.*
[Faye1]
[Newln]Hey. 
[Faye2]
[Newln]It's good to see you.
[Faye1]
[Newln]I want to practice some, but there's too many people watching the dart floor.
[Newln]*Faye sighs.*
[Newln]I'm really too far in my own head. This isn't even about being seen.
[Newln]I feel like they always judge my play.
[Newln]Do you get nervous up there?
        [Display]Of course.
                [Answer]I don't know how you do it without a complaint then.
        [Display]If I let myself.
                [Answer]You're tough.
        [Display]Never.

[Newln]I love this game more than anything.
[Newln]I love being good at this game more than anything.
[Faye1]
[Newln]I know I can do this.
[Faye2]
[Newln]I just need to be the me I want to be. Everyone else can just watch.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye looks at you intently.*
[Newln]You've been an incredible listener for me. I think I just needed to get it out.
[Newln]When I say it out loud to you, for some reason, it's so much easier to face it all.
[Newln]I feel like I've gotten a burst of energy just from talking with you tonight.
[Newln]It feels like I could play in front of a stadium like it's nothing at all.
[Newln]So please...
[Newln]Be my partner for the final round of the tournament.
[Faye2]
[Newln]There's no one else here I can imagine doing it with.
[Newln]You don't have to worry about answering now.
[Newln]Call me over when you're ready.

[0]Don't worry... Bad days happen...
[0]Don't be embarrassed, I'm pretty sure nobody else saw that.
[Below70]At least play like that won't grab any attention.
[Below70]I think we can still win.
[Highton]I can't take my eyes off your darts...
[Highton]You're setting the bar kind of high, aren't you?
[Highton]People are starting to watch...

Banter Lines Finals (During Darts Finals)
[0Final]I can get us back, we can do this.
[Below70Final]Don't be shy, score high!
[Below70Final]Forget the crowd, just focus on the board. That's all that matters!
[LowtonFinal]Come on, let's give them a show.
[HightonFinal]Perfect, show them what we've got.
[HightonFinal]Everyone's eyes went wide watching that one.
[HightonFinal]It's like you and the darts are in your own world.
[HightonFinal]Wicked. 
[180Final]Seriously, you have to teach me some time.
[180Final]Are you playing to entertain? You're giving them a show.
[180Final]Let them watch. We've got this!
[CheckoutFinal]I hope everyone saw that.




Final Scene
[Newln]*The game is yours. And so is the trophy.*
[Faye2]
[Newln]We did it!
[Newln]*Faye is quick to go to the side of the trophy.*
[Newln]*You see her beckon you over.*
[Newln]Come on, you get to hold it.
[Newln]*You take hold of the prize and Faye stands at your side facing the crowd.*
[Newln]*Cameras begin to flash off.*
[Newln]The crowd was one thing, but if I see my picture posted in this bar next time...
[Newln]*Before many more pictures can be taken, Faye leads you away and back to her booth.*
[AreaLounge]
[Newln]I think we lost them.
[Newln]I don't know if I'm ready to have my picture plastered everywhere.
[Newln]Well, at least you're in it with me.
[Newln]*She looks at the booth.*
[Newln]*Taking one of her darts from its holster, Faye leaves it on the table.*
[Newln]I think I should go back there. Maybe it's good for me to be seen.
[Newln]*Then she reaches for the trophy. You hand it over.*
[Newln]Yeah. But, I need to do it on my own.
[Newln]I can't always rely on you for support.
[Newln]Even if I know you'd always give it.
[Newln]*She nods, confident, then walks away, back into the crowd.*
[None1]
[Newln]*You look back to the dart she left behind. There's a small piece of paper wrapped around it.*
[Newln]*It's a note.*
[Newln]*It reads, “Thanks for everything. I'm no good with goodbyes. See you next tournament. - Faye”*
[Newln]*You decide to keep both the dart and note as mementos.*
[Newln]*As you're about to leave, you see Faye talking with some crowd members, taking pictures with her and the trophy. All smiles.*


Jessica Fletcher


Scene One (Dance floor) (0 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You see a unique woman dancing.*
[Newln]*Your eyes meet briefly and she walks over to you shortly after.*
[Jess1]
[Newln]Is there something you want?
        [Display]You.
                [Answer][Jess3]What a desperate thing for a professional to say.
        [Display]Nothing in particular.
                [Answer][Jess2][RaiseJessLove3]My mistake then.
        [Display]...
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove1]You are quite odd.
[Jess1]
[Newln]I just came to ask you to stop staring.
[Newln]It's off putting.
[Newln]*She begins to return to her dancing, but stops and returns to you.*
[Newln]I need a dance partner.
[Newln]*She waits for a moment.*
[Newln]Well...
[Newln]Aren't you going to ask me to dance?
[Newln]*You take her onto the dance floor and dance with her.
[Newln]You're quite good at this.
[Newln]*She smirks.*
[Newln]I'm Jessica Fletcher.
[Newln]And I asked you to stop staring...
[Newln]*You and Jessica dance for a while.*


Scene Two (Darts) (1 Love) (Refactored)
[Jess1]
[Newln]I wouldn't typically partner up with someone I don't know rather well.
[Newln]However, with my skills I don't mind the possibility of losing out on a few points.
[Newln]Even if you missed the board with most of your throws, I still think we could pull through.
[Newln]What about you?
[Newln]Will you hold up your end of the game?
        [Display]I don't miss my mark. 
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove2][Jess2]Well, aren't you the confident one.
        [Display]I haven't decided yet. 
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove3][Jess2]Indecision is an underrated trait.
        [Display]I'll try. 
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove1]*She chuckles*.
                [Answer]I suppose we both will.
[Jess1]
[Newln]I'll let you go first.
[Newln]I would very much appreciate it if you didn't make me work too hard to win.


Scene Three (Bar) (+ Intoxication) (6 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You find Jessica sitting at the bar.*
[Newln]*You notice how much she stands out from others. She looks like blood in blue water.*
[Jess1]
[Newln]You again?
[Newln]Maybe I should've seen it coming.
[Newln]You know drinking will only worsen your game.
[Newln]Speaking of darts...
[Newln]I've never heard of you before tonight.
[Newln]Truthfully, I thought you might be some lucky startup to make it here.
[Newln]I guess we will see by the end of the event.
[Jess2]
[Newln]If we both make it that far. Though, I feel confident enough with my share of that.
[Jess1]
[Newln]So. What do you want to talk about?
        [Display]Love. 
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove2][Jess2]Maybe after I've had more to drink.
        [Display]Death. 
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove3][Jess2]*She laughs lightly.*
                [Answer]I could've expected you to say something macabre and shocking like that.
        [Display]Taxes. 
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove1]God help us.
[Jess1]
[Newln]Maybe I should have asked why you keep coming up to socialize with me.
[Newln]Yes. That's a much better question.
[Newln]*Jessica faces you and waits for an answer.*
[Newln]So?
        [Display]Your skill.
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove3][Jess2]It's refreshing that someone sees past the beauty to see the darts player that I truly am.
        [Display]Your beauty.
                [Answer]*She sighs.*
                [Answer]At least you're trying.
        [Display]No reason in particular.
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove2][Jess2]I'll call that a lie.
                [Answer]But fine, keep the reason to yourself.
[Jess1]
[Newln]*Jessica faces away from you toward the bar.*
[Newln]I've changed my mind again. 
[Newln]Let's talk about what you mentioned before, as irrelevant as it is.
[Newln]*You and Jessica talk for a while.*[RaiseIntox1][RaiseJessIntox1]


Scene Four Optional (Bathroom) - Requires drunk Jessica (Removes all Intox) (11 Love) (Refactored)
[Jess4]
[Newln]*You run into Jessica as you walk into the bathroom.*
[Newln]Oh. It's you.
[Newln]Don't tell anybody, but I just made a girl cry in the bathroom.
[Newln]I just told her her dartplay is like art.
[Newln]*She gasps.*
[Newln]I might've said something other than art.
[Newln]*She stares at you for a second
[Newln]*Jessica burps.*
[Newln]*Rumbles of worse things sound out from her as well.*
[Newln]Oh god.
[Newln]I'm going back inside. People can't see me get sick.
[Newln]*She grabs your arm and pulls you all the way into a stall.*
[Newln]*Unceremoniously, she drops down over the porcelain.*
[Newln]Hold my hair please...
[Newln]*She vomits into the toilet.*
[Newln]This is your fault.
[Newln]Buying me drinks all night long.
        [Display]I didn't force you to drink them. 
                [Answer][RaiseJessLove1]Semantics are fallacious, you know.
 [Display]I'm taking responsibility. 
        [Answer][RaiseJessLove2]I'd say you're doing the bare minimum by being here.
[Display]You're not enjoying this? 
        [Answer][RaiseJessLove3]*She laughs.*
        [Answer]I think you are scum, you know.
[Newln]*Jessica vomits again.*
[Newln]Just stay here for a little while longer.
[Newln]I have to say you are a lovely hair holder by the way.
[Newln]*You stay with Jessica for a while until she feels better.*[ResetIntoxJess]


Scene Five (Lounge) (14 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You sit next to Jessica at a lounge table.*
[Jess1]
[Newln]Hello.
[Jess2]
[Newln]I'm glad you found some time for another visit.
[Jess1]
[Newln]There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
[Newln]Let's talk for a moment before that though.
[Newln]*Jessica sighs.*
[Newln]It seems that nobody will be my partner for the final round.
[Newln]Unfortunately, it appears I scare everyone away.
[Newln]Except you.
[Newln]I think people would call me “odd”.
[Newln]I think those people are odd.
[Newln]Or maybe just intelligent.
[Newln]They don't even know who I really am.
[Newln]They don't bother to try to get to know me.
[Newln]That's what I wanted to ask you.
[Newln]What do you think of me?
        [Display]You're amazing.
                [Answer][Jess2]Are you really not ashamed of your honesty?
        [Display]You're Jessica.
                [Answer][Jess3]Nevermind.
                [Answer]You should go.
                [Answer]*You leave.*
                [Answer][JessFail][SceneExit]
        [Display]You're prickly.
                [Answer][Jess2]*She smiles.*
                [Answer]I know you don't think that.
                [Answer]And even if you do, you've earned that opinion.
[Jess1]
[JessSuccess]
[Newln]Well, I think you're great.
[Newln]I don't know why. 
[Newln]Frankly, you're a complete idiot.
[Newln]And your dart skills are...
[Jess2]
[Newln]Interesting at best.
[Jess1]
[Newln]However, despite all the negatives, you seem to be a diamond in the rough.
[Newln]*Jessica looks at you intently.*
[Newln]Please. 
[Newln]Consider me to be your partner for the final round.
[Newln]*Jessica relaxes.*
[Newln]With that off my chest you can go. I don't need an answer this minute. It's smart to think over a big choice like that.
[Jess2]
[Newln]I didn't have to though.
[Jess1]
[Newln]Thank you for hearing me out either way. I hope it's not too unexpected of a request.
[Jess2]
[Newln]Really.

Banter Lines (During Darts)
[0]Interesting, but not in a good way...
[0]I think I've seen worse, but not entirely sure.
[Below70]Is that everything you have to show me?
[Below70]Mediocrity is death, luckily there's still time to change.
[Highton]Those throws were almost like art. Almost.
[Highton]Would you say that a high score is unique for you or expected?
[Highton]For some reason, part of me thinks you're cheating.
[Highton]Talk about a big fish.
[180]Am I seeing that right?
[180]Well that's humbling.
[180]The longer I spend around you the more interesting you become.
[Checkout]It's just too easy for me.
[Checkout]Well, it wasn't too hard to carry you to the end at least.
[Checkout]I doubt you could've done that without my help.




Banter Lines Finals (During Darts Finals)
[0Final]Well, I'm sure we both have enough awards already anyways.
[Below70Final]Slow and steady, there's hope yet.
[Below70Final]Did something take your focus?
[LowtonFinal]Any less than that and I'd be worried about you.
[LowtonFinal]We both know you're better than middle of the road.
[HightonFinal]That was interesting at worst.
[HightonFinal]That's nearly masterwork.
[HightonFinal]You're certainly the good kind of unnatural.
[HightonFinal]Show them who you really are.
[180Final]That was art.
[180Final]The other's are terrified, and they should be. You're a monster.
[180Final]It's darts that she wrote.
[CheckoutFinal]And that's all we wrote!




Final Scene
[Jess2]
[Newln]*Jessica pulls you away from the plate over to the nearby trophy.*
[Newln]Lift it with me.
[Newln]*It's a bit of a whirlwind second, but your hand finds its way to the prize.*
[Newln]*You both lift it together, high up for the crowd to see it.*
[Newln]*A healthy cheer begins for you.*
[Newln]*Just after, camera flashes begin.*
[Newln]*A moment later, it fades and the crowd turns into a sea of moving people.*
[Newln]Quite a time, don't you think?
[Newln]*Jessica's smile is barely constrained onto her face.*
[Newln]That felt much more than just another game of darts.
[Newln]I feel like something's been lifted off my chest finally.
[Newln]I'm not entirely sure how to describe it. I don't think I even knew I needed that.
[Newln]Though, it seems you knew, somehow.
[Newln]Or maybe it's just coincidence.
[Newln]It wouldn't be the first time life has been funny to me that way.
[Newln]But, I'll keep this simple now rather than mudding the water with all that.
[Newln]*She leans forward and kisses your cheek.*
[Newln]Sorry for the forwardness.
[Newln]Just consider it an open invitation to partner up again sometime.
[Newln]*A bit stunned, you watch her back up into the crowd.*
[Newln]*For the first time since you met her, Jessica blends in perfectly.*
[None1]
[Newln]*She disappears from sight.*
[Newln]*You start to head after her, but it's no use.*
[Newln]*After a few minutes of searching you accept you lost her.*
[Newln]*She took the trophy with her as well.*
[Newln]*Though, you notice she left one of her darts in your pocket.*
[Newln]*You feel confident it'll find its way back to its rightful owner soon enough.*




Elaine Guzmán


Scene One (Bar) (0 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You sit next to a woman invested in a trio of darts sitting in front of her on the table.*
[Elaine1]
[Newln]I don't know you. You should leave.
        [Display]Why?
                [Answer]Because, I can just tell that you're annoying.
        [Display]No.
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove1][Elaine2]Better to be brave and annoying than be a coward and annoying.
        [Display]... 
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove3][Elaine2]Well if you're gonna be agreeable and keep your mouth shut I'll let you stay.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]You know what, you should stay.
[Elaine2]
[Newln]You seem fun to belittle.
[Newln]Especially since I have no clue who you are.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]*She stares at you for a second.*
[Newln]Name.
[Newln]*She hides a smile while you give your name.*
[Elaine2]
[Newln]Sorry, you just have the name of an amateur.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]I'm Elaine Guzmán. Also known as the dart goddess.
[Newln]Any conceited idiot bold enough to say they're the best hasn't met me yet.
[Elaine2]
[Newln]Not even that Chadrick freak can keep up with me.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]And now that I know your name I know for sure you're not even close to me.
[Newln]But, like I said, I've been in the market for a punching bag.
[Elaine3]
[Newln]So don't act like I didn't warn you.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]*You sit quietly as Elaine insults you for a while.*




Scene Two (Darts) (1 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*Elaine holds a trio of darts in her hands and appears to give a brief prayer before speaking to you.*
[Elaine1]
[Newln]Alright. My prayers to myself are finished.
[Newln]Now try and fetch me some points this game.
[Newln]Think you can do that?
        [Display]Maybe.
                [Answer]Indecision is a plague on humanity.
        [Display]... 
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove2][Elaine2]Oh, my bad. Forgot I told you to shut up before.
        [Display]Yes ma'am. 
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove3][Elaine2]*Elaine raises an eyebrow.*
                [Answer]You have no shame do you.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]Alright you first.
[Newln]And I'll need time to stop the hysterical laughter your dartplay will bring out of me.
[Elaine2]
[Newln]So be ready for a long game.


Scene Three (Lounge) (6 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You walk up to Elaine who is again fidgeting with a few darts on the table in front of her.*
[Elaine1]
[Newln]Hey.
[Newln]*She seems like she's out of fire, simmering rather than the usual crackling.*
[Newln]Sit.
[Newln]I was thinking about the tournament.
[Newln]Is it really fair for me to even be here?
        [Display]Not even a little.
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove3][Elaine2]My thoughts exactly.
        [Display]It's fair.
                [Answer][Elaine3]Have you had your eyes closed all night?
                [Answer]I'm killing it.
        [Display]...
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove2][Elaine2]*Elaine scoffs.*
                [Answer]You're allowed to speak you know.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]This tournament bothers me.
[Newln]It's a professional tournament, but it's not enough for me.
[Newln]I want to go international.
[Newln]Bumming it in these bars and easily winning these tournaments is beneath me.
[Elaine2]
[Newln]*She pats your head.*
[Newln]And belittling underachievers like yourself has lost its charm.
[Newln]You know what, I have you to thank for this eureka.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]I really do owe you one.
[Newln]Anyways. Can you leave now?
[Elaine3]
[Newln]You honestly smell horrible and it's definitely noticeable.
[Elaine1]
[Newln]*You leave Elaine to enjoy her fantasizations of international fame, but you find yourself picturing it as well.*


Scene Four Optional (Darts) (Removes all Intox) (10 Love) (Refactored)
[Elaine4]
[Newln]*You see Elaine throwing dart after dart at a board nearby.*
[Newln]Hey! Doggie!
[Newln]*She's plastered.*
[Newln]Come here and look. Look at this trick.
[Newln]*Elaine sets up a throw with all three darts in hand.*
[Newln]*She throws all three at once. One hits the bullseye and the rest bounce off.*
[Newln]Come on!
[Newln]Hey, go stand in front of the board for me.
        [Display]Why?
                [Answer]Are you stupid?
        [Display]...
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove2]Yes! The silence is so loud from you.
        [Display]*Walk over.*
                [Answer][RaiseElaineLove3]Good. Very good.
[Newln]Get in place.
[Newln]Now.
[Newln]*You stand in front of the board with your head covering most of it.*
[Newln]*A small crowd has gathered.*
[Newln]*You contemplate the actions that have led you to this moment.*
[Newln]So I just have to land these darts without disfiguring you.
[Newln]One next to each ear and one right above the head.
[Newln]Easy.
[Newln]*Elaine readies her three dart trick again.*
[Newln]*She throws. You close your eyes.*
[Newln]Yes! I did it!
[Newln]*The darts landed just as she had called.*
[Newln]Aren't you impressed? I'm a real deal dart goddess.
[Newln]*The crowd claps and then they disperse.*
[Newln]*Elaine walks over to you with a wide smile.*
[Newln]Hey. 
[Newln]You weren't worried were you?
[Newln]*She gives you a strangle-like hug.*
[Newln]This is your reward for Intoxicating this goddess.
[Newln]Keep acting like that and you might just win my divine favor.
[Newln]*You spend some time getting a mix of praise and beration from her.*[ResetElaineIntox]

[Newln]Come back later.
        [Display]I'm staying.
                [Answer]*Elaine shakes her head in disbelief.
        [Display]No.
                [Answer]*Elaine looks genuinely surprised at your response.*
        [Display]Well if you say so... 
                [Answer]*Elaine grabs your arm before you can leave and makes you remain seated.*
[Newln]I don't know what sick game you've been playing all night spending time with me just to get treated poorly.
[Newln]But, it has gotten me thinking about what I'm really doing to you.
[Newln]It's not been for good fun or some reason like that.
[Newln]I genuinely think of you as less than me at all levels.
[Newln]That's what I think of everyone here.
[Newln]*Elaine looks at you with a look of concern.*
[Newln]Am I just a great dart player with no other redeeming qualities?
        [Display]Yes.
                [Answer][Elaine3]*Elaine looks disturbed.*
                [Answer]Just go away.
[Answer][ElaineFail][SceneExit]
        [Display]You've been great.
                [Answer][Elaine2]*She looks dumbfounded.*
        [Display]You have redeeming qualities.
                [Answer][Elaine2]*She looks at you like you just saved her life.
[Elaine1]
[ElaineSuccess]
[Newln]You think so?
[Newln]After all the things I've said to you?
[Newln]It's not just you either, I'm terrible to everyone.
[Newln]*You nod.*
[Elaine2]
[Newln]Wow.
[Newln]You're the first person to be appreciative of me in...
[Newln]I don't even know. Maybe my whole life.
[Newln]*She grabs a dart from one of her pockets.*
[Newln]This is for you.
[Newln]You're not beneath me anymore.
[Newln]You're someone worth my respect.
[Newln]*She smiles.*
[Newln]Sometimes...
[Elaine1]
[Newln]You know.
[Newln]I'd like to be your partner for the final round.
