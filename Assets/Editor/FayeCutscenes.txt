Faye/Faybian Artel (Faye)


Scene One (Lounge) (0 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*While walking past a booth, you accidentally trip on someone's leg. You fall face first onto the ground.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*A young woman is the culprit. She kneels down next to you and sits you up.*
[Newln]Ugh, me and my long legs. Here, that looks painful.
[Newln]*She grabs a drink from her table and puts the cold glass onto your forehead.*
[Newln]For the swelling.
[Newln]*The woman tending your blunder looks away whenever you look at her face.*
[Newln]*Something about her face is catching your attention.*
        [Display]You're a beautiful woman. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove3][Faye2]*A heavy blush covers her face.*
        [Display]You're a man?
                [Answer][Faye3]*She casts a disapproving face.*
        [Display]What are you looking at?
[Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Umm, nothing.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*She helps you off the ground onto your feet.*        
[Newln]Just come sit with me for a minute to recover.
[Newln]*You sit in the booth.*
[Newln]*You notice the upholstery to be only average in quality.*
[Newln]*The woman sighs and moves further into the shadow of the booth.*
[Newln]Everyone's looking this way now because of you.
[Newln]Well, really it's my fault. Should've watched my reach.
[Newln]I wish this was easier...
[Newln]*You stare blankly at her, a look lacking context.*
[Newln]You're new aren't you.
[Newln]Well I'll tell you since everyone else knows anyway.
[Newln]I'm a woman. Or, you know, transitioned to a woman if that makes more sense to you.
        [Display]Makes sense to me.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove2][Faye2]That saves me the trouble of having to explain.
        [Display]Wait so... 
                [Answer][Faye3]That reaction is the worst. Why's it so hard to understand?
        [Display]...
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Please stop staring already... 
[Faye1]
[Newln]Anyway. My tournament name is Faybian Artel.
[Newln]Call me Faye though please.
[Newln]I just haven't found the time to legally change it.
[Newln]*She bumps her head against the back of the booth in a small concession.*
[Newln]Or the money...
[Newln]It's not cheap doing this.
[Newln]*Faye motions away from the booth.*
[Newln]If you're interested in talking then come back later.
[Newln]People have their eyes on you and it's bothering me.
[Newln]Sorry.
[Newln]*You leave Faye to her booth.*
[Newln]*You notice how hard it is to see her even just a few feet away from the booth.*




Scene Two (Darts) (1 Love) (Refactored)
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye looks nervous.*
[Newln]Make your turns quick please.
[Newln]I don't like being up and about, especially with a crowd.
[Newln]And yeah, I was meaning to ask if you ever attended any other tournaments.
[Newln]You didn't look familiar, but people don't always look the same from one meet to the next.
        [Display]I stick to the shadows.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove3][Faye2]Same.
                [Answer]We must've just missed each other then.
        [Display]I'm a regular. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Really?
                [Answer]I've seen just about everyone here before.
        [Display]This is my first one. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove2]Oh I see.
                [Answer][Faye2]Don't worry. You'll probably do ok.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye focuses up.*
[Newln]I apologize in advance that I'm not the best player here. 
[Newln]Here, you go first.




Scene Three (Bar) (8 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You see Faye at the bar.*
[Newln]*The owner is talking with her while she orders a drink.*
[Newln]*You move closer to hear what they're saying.*
[Owner1]
[Newln]Going on your tab, right Fabyian?
[Faye1]
[Newln]Umm, it's actually Faye now.
[Owner1]
[Newln]It's easier for me to call you Faybian though.
[Newln]I've known that name for years. You and my daughter have been friends since you were little, you know.
[Newln]Can't I just call you that?
[Newln]*You walk up to the conversation.*
[Faye2]
[Newln]*Faye notices you, looking over.*
[Newln]It's you.
[Owner1]
[Newln]Can I get you something?
        [Display]Whatever she ordered. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]Sure. I'll grab that for you.
                [Answer]*The owner turns around to prepare the drink.*
        [Display]Just fetching Faye. 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove3]*The owner places Faye's drink in front of her and moves to the next customer.*
        [Display]No I'm good.
                [Answer]Sounds good.
                [Answer]Anyways.
                [Answer]*Before he can continue his previous thought, another customer calls him over.*
                [Answer]Excuse me.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye grabs your arm with one hand and grabs her drink with the other. Leading you back to her lounge booth.*
[AreaLounge]
[Newln]*You both sit down in the booth.*
[Faye3]
[Newln]*Faye looks irritated.*
[Newln]I hate this league. No matter who I talk to, it's always the same question.
[Newln]Like, do they think they can just determine who I am and I just have to deal with that?
[Faye1]
[Newln]*She sighs and drinks.*
[Newln]Maybe I should just quit and go somewhere else.
[Newln]Where nobody knew me before.
        [Display]Maybe.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]*She frowns.*
                [Answer]I hate ‘maybe's'.
        [Display]Is it really that bad?
                [Answer][Faye3]Yes.
        [Display]Screw that.
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove2][Faye2]*Faye smiles lightly.*
                [Answer]I'm a darts player first after all.
[Faye1]
[Newln]I worry too much about it. It's almost obsessive.
[Newln]I think I'm better off just being who I am.
[Newln]It's time to get over worrying about all the little things that come with that.
[Newln]*Faye becomes recomposed.*
[Newln]I'll keep going. Things will get better.
[Faye2]
[Newln]I love this game too much.
[Newln]Thanks for helping get me away from that idiot by the way.
[Newln]*You spend some time with Faye in her booth.*




Scene Four Optional (Lounge) Requires Drunk Faye (13 Love)  (Removes all Intox) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You walk up to Faye's booth, but she's not there.
[Newln]*Suddenly, you feel a pull on your leg.*
[Faye4]
[Newln]Hey. Down here.
[Newln]*You look down to see Faye hiding underneath the table.*
[Newln]Come down here.
[Newln]It's so nice down here.
[Newln]*You find yourself huddled with Faye underneath the table.*
[Newln]*She has lined empty glasses along the wall.*
[Newln]*The total is staggering.*
[Newln]Look! My masterpiece.
[Newln]Isn't it beautiful?
        [Display]It's artwork. [RaiseFayeLove2]
                [Answer]You're too sweet.
        [Display]If I look at it this way... 
                [Answer][RaiseFayeLove1]*Faye rolls her eyes.*
                [Answer]Oh my god.
                [Answer]The fact I can even stack them while this drunk I think I deserve an award.
        [Display]I could do better.
                [Answer][RaiseLove3]*Faye pouts*
                [Answer]You're so cruel.
[Newln]*She sways a bit, but then she straightens herself out.*
[Newln]I'd like to dedicate my masterpiece to this jerk.
[Newln]*Faye points to you while holding one of the glasses like a microphone.*
[Newln]Without them I'd never have gotten this drunk.
[Newln]They are my inspiration.
[Newln]And I'd also like to thank...
[Newln]*She pauses, lost in thought.*
[Newln]What was their name?
[Newln]*You spend some time attending Faye's imaginary award ceremony under the table.*[ResetFayeIntox]




Scene Five (Darts) (17 Love) (Refactored)
[Newln]*You see Faye watching some other players.*
[Newln]*She waves you over.*
[Faye1]
[Newln]Hey. 
[Faye2]
[Newln]It's good to see you.
[Faye1]
[Newln]I want to practice some, but there's too many people watching the dart floor.
[Newln]*Faye sighs.*
[Newln]I'm really too far in my own head. This isn't even about being seen.
[Newln]I feel like they always judge my play.
[Newln]Do you get nervous up there?
        [Display]Of course.
                [Answer]I don't know how you do it without a complaint then.
        [Display]If I let myself.
                [Answer]You're tough.
        [Display]Never.
                [Answer][Faye3]Nevermind.

[Newln]*Faye looks determined.*
[Faye2]
[Newln]I love this game more than anything.
[Newln]I love being good at this game more than anything.
[Faye1]
[Newln]I know I can do this.
[Faye2]
[Newln]I just need to be the me I want to be. Everyone else can just watch.
[Faye1]
[Newln]*Faye looks at you intently.*
[Newln]You've been an incredible listener for me. I think I just needed to get it out.
[Newln]When I say it out loud to you, for some reason, it's so much easier to face it all.
[Newln]I feel like I've gotten a burst of energy just from talking with you tonight.
[Newln]It feels like I could play in front of a stadium like it's nothing at all.
[Newln]So please...
[Newln]Be my partner for the final round of the tournament.
[Faye2]
[Newln]There's no one else here I can imagine doing it with.
[Newln]You don't have to worry about answering now.

[Newln]*Faye heads back to her booth with a big smile on her face.*

Banter Lines (During Darts)
[0]Don't worry... Bad days happen...
[0]Don't be embarrassed, I'm pretty sure nobody else saw that.
[Below70]At least play like that won't grab any attention.
[Below70]I think we can still win.
[Highton]I can't take my eyes off your darts...
[Highton]You're setting the bar kind of high, aren't you?
[Highton]People are starting to watch...
[180]Teach me.
[180]You're that good?
[180]You're drawing attention with that...
[Checkout]Perfect, now let's get off the plate already.
[Checkout]Doubles put so much less pressure on me... Good job.
[Checkout]I'm checked out in more ways than one. I'm heading back to the booth.






Banter Lines Finals (During Darts Finals)
[0Final]I can get us back, we can do this.

[Below70Final]Forget the crowd, just focus on the board. That's all that matters!
[LowtonFinal]Come on, let's give them a show.
[HightonFinal]Perfect, show them what we've got.
[HightonFinal]Everyone's eyes went wide watching that one.
[HightonFinal]It's like you and the darts are in your own world.
[HightonFinal]Wicked. 
[180Final]Seriously, you have to teach me some time.
[180Final]Are you playing to entertain? You're giving them a show.

Final Scene
[Newln]*The game is yours. And so is the trophy.*
[Faye2]
[Newln]We did it!
[Newln]*Faye is quick to go to the side of the trophy.*
[Newln]*You see her beckon you over.*
[Newln]Come on, you get to hold it.
[Newln]*You take hold of the prize and Faye stands at your side facing the crowd.*
[Newln]*Cameras begin to flash off.*
[Newln]The crowd was one thing, but if I see my picture posted in this bar next time...
[Newln]*Before many more pictures can be taken, Faye leads you away and back to her booth.*
[AreaLounge]
[Newln]I think we lost them.
[Newln]I don't know if I'm ready to have my picture plastered everywhere.
[Newln]Well, at least you're in it with me.
[Newln]*She looks at the booth.*
[Newln]*Taking one of her darts from its holster, Faye leaves it on the table.*
[Newln]I think I should go back there. Maybe it's good for me to be seen.
[Newln]*Then she reaches for the trophy. You hand it over.*
[Newln]Yeah. But, I need to do it on my own.
[Newln]I can't always rely on you for support.
[Newln]Even if I know you'd always give it.
[Newln]*She nods, confident, then walks away, back into the crowd.*
[None1]
[Newln]*You look back to the dart she left behind. There's a small piece of paper wrapped around it.*
[Newln]*It's a note.*
[Newln]*It reads, “Thanks for everything. I'm no good with goodbyes. See you next tournament. - Faye”*
[Newln]*You decide to keep both the dart and note as mementos.*
[Newln]*As you're about to leave, you see Faye talking with some crowd members, taking pictures with her and the trophy. All smiles.*
