Summary: You are personally invited to participate in this brand new darts experience. Throw with the best of them from the greater east coast region. Teams of two compete against the clock and the board to qualify for the final round of the tournament. Only one team of two will make it to the final checkout!

Info: Rounds begin at 5pm, final pair determined at 830pm. Tournament is point style, meaning only the player with the most points will play in the finals. Points are scored by winning games of -01. All rounds must be played with a partner of your choosing, however, there are no restrictions on how many partners a player may have over the evening. Furthermore, only one player will qualify for the final round. If there is a tie, priority will be dealt with a coin toss. At that point, they will choose their partner for the finals. If they fail to check out the final game, the runner up will be allowed a shot at the prize. This will continue until a winner is chosen!
